<p>Granny's origin, and what she actually is, is unknown. In fact, Granny's hazy eyes glow in the darkness and differ colors, It's known that she has a relationship with the ghost of Slendrina, and that she can revive herself after being killed and more tie her to the supernatural. But the appearance of Grandpa in Granny 2 and her being mentioned in Granny 3 play store description as being Slendrina's grandmother imply that she once was a human.

It is possible that Granny may be or has once been a cannibal, as shown by the blood splatters belonging to the Previous Victim scattered throughout her house, and her jumpscare animation in the Basement Game Over scene, where she lunges at The player with her mouth wide open, possibly eating him alive.
